NAP Pedal Calibrator

This script calibrates the comma pedal interceptor for your pre-AP Tesla Model S.

PRECONDITIONS:
  1. Car must be ON
  2. Gear must be in NEUTRAL
  3. Brake pedal must be PRESSED and held
  4. Do NOT press the accelerator pedal during calibration

The calibration process will:
  - Detect pedal zero position
  - Detect pedal maximum position
  - Fine-tune the scale factor
  - Validate the calibration values
  - Save calibration to params

Press START when ready to begin calibration."""

NAP Radar Calibrator

This script displays filtered radar points to help align the Bosch radar.

PRECONDITIONS:
  1. Vehicle must be safely parked
  2. Radar must be properly mounted and connected
  3. Place a calibration target 3-10m ahead, centered on the vehicle axis

The calibration display will show:
  - Radar points within 2.5-14.5m ahead
  - Lateral offset from center
  - Adjust radar aim until target shows ~0.0m lateral

Press START when ready to begin."""

NAP Radar Test

This script displays live radar data for testing and verification.

The test will show:
  - All detected radar points
  - Distance and relative velocity
  - Track status and confidence

This is useful for:
  - Verifying radar installation
  - Checking radar alignment
  - Debugging radar issues

Press START to begin the radar test."""

EPAS Firmware Flash

STEP 1 — POWER THE CAR ON NOW:
  - Key fob inside the car
  - Foot on the brake
  - Car should be in Park and stay there
  - Do not drive
  (The EPAS ECU only responds when the car is on.)

WARNING: This will modify your steering system firmware!

POWER REQUIREMENTS:
  - 12V battery must be healthy and at a normal charge
  - Do NOT start the flash if the car has been sitting cold
    with marginal voltage
  - Power loss DURING the flash will brick the EPAS module

RISKS:
  - Incorrect firmware can disable power steering
  - Interrupted flash can brick the EPAS module
  - This modification may void warranties

Only proceed if you:
  - Fully understand the implications
  - Have backup EPAS firmware available
  - Are comfortable with the risks involved

Press START only if you accept these risks."""

EPAS Firmware Backup

STEP 1 — POWER THE CAR ON NOW:
  - Key fob inside the car
  - Foot on the brake
  - Car should be in Park and stay there
  - Do not drive
  (The EPAS ECU only responds when the car is on. If the car
   is not on, the script will time out.)

This action only reads the stock EPAS firmware and saves it.
No flashing or firmware modifications are performed.

Run this before any Flash operation so you have a local backup.

PRECONDITIONS:
  - Stable 12V power
  - Do not power-cycle during extraction

Press START to extract the EPAS firmware backup."""

STEP 1 — POWER THE CAR ON NOW:

  - Do not drive
  (The EPAS ECU only responds when the car is on.)

WARNING: This will reflash your steering system firmware!

POWER REQUIREMENTS:
  - 12V battery must be healthy and at a normal charge
  - Do NOT start the restore if the car has been sitting cold
    with marginal voltage
  - Power loss DURING the restore will brick the EPAS module

This operation:
  - Uses the extracted stock EPAS firmware image
  - May take several minutes to complete
  - Should NOT be interrupted once started

RISKS:
  - Interrupted flash can brick the EPAS module
  - Incorrect image can disable power steering

Only proceed if you:
  - Need to return to stock EPAS firmware
  - Understand and accept the risks

Press START only if you accept these risks."""
